# Copy Plain Text

Copying text from VS Code includes the formatting which is nice until you paste into a program that is not very format aware - for me this was Gmail and pasting would always include the formatted text but I just wanted plain-text. Work arounds were annoying so I thought I'd try making an extension for it.

## Features

Adds a single simple command palette called "Copy Plain Text" which will copy the currently selected text to the clipboard with no formatting.
